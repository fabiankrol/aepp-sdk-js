# Quick Start
In this example we will send 1 _AE_ coin from one account to another

## 1. Specify imports
For the following snippets in the guide you need to specify multiple imports. Most imports like `Universal`, `MemoryAccount` & `Node` are [Stamps](https://stampit.js.org/essentials/what-is-a-stamp) that compose certain functionalities. Others like `AmountFormatter` & `Crypto` are util modules with typical function exports.

```js
const {
  Universal,
  MemoryAccount,
  Node,
  AmountFormatter,
  Crypto
} = require('@aeternity/aepp-sdk')
```

## 2. Create a Keypair for sender

```js
  const keypair = Crypto.generateKeyPair()
  console.log(`Secret key: ${keypair.secretKey}`)
  console.log(`Public key: ${keypair.publicKey}`)
```

## 3. Get some _AE_ using the Faucet
To receive some _AE_ you can use the [Faucet](https://faucet.aepps.com/). Just paste sender's publicKey, hit `Top UP` and you'll immediately get some test coins.

## 4. Interact with the Ã¦ternity blockchain
This example shows:

- how to create an instance of the SDK using the `Universal` [Stamp](https://stampit.js.org/essentials/what-is-a-stamp)
- how to spend (send) 1 AE from the account the SDK instance was initialized with to some other AE address

```js
const NODE_URL = 'https://testnet.aeternity.io';
const COMPILER_URL = 'https://compiler.aepps.com'; // required for contract interactions
const senderAccount = MemoryAccount({
  // replace <SENDER_SECRET> and <SENDER_PUBLIC_KEY> with the generated keyppair from step 2
  keypair: { secretKey: '<SENDER_SECRET>', publicKey: '<SENDER_PUBLIC_KEY>' }
})

(async function () {
  const node = await Node({ url: NODE_URL })
  const aeSdk = await Universal({
     compilerUrl: COMPILER_URL,
     nodes: [ { name: 'testnet', instance: node } ],
     accounts: [ senderAccount ]
  })

  // spend one AE
  await aeSdk.spend(1, '<RECIPIENT_PUBLIC_KEY>', {
      // replace <RECIPIENT_PUBLIC_KEY>, Ideally you use public key from Superhero Wallet you have created before
      denomination: AmountFormatter.AE_AMOUNT_FORMATS.AE
  })
})()
```

Note:

- You may remove code from Step 2 as this serves only for one-time creation
- By default the `spend` function expects the amount to be spent in `aettos` (the smallest possible unit)
- Following the example snippet you would specify `AE` as denomination
- See [Testnet Explorer](https://explorer.testnet.aeternity.io/) and track your transactions
